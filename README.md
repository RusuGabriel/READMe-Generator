## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The project has in the ```./src/resources``` folder a series of README.md templates which the Python scripts parse into tokens and asks the user the appropriate questions for each section of the template to fill the result README.

The program will ask for a multiline or single line answers for some of the section questions to allow the user to give answers as detailed as they need for the result README.
